LabGuide on Kinesis Data Firehose
Objective: In this lab, we shall learn how to streamline the data from Firehose and store it in a S3
bucket in a form of an object.
Pre- requisite: Create a S3 bucket which will be used as a target.
Step 1
Select data firehose under kinesis services and click create delivery stream.
Step 2
Give a name for the delivery stream
Step 3
Select a source to send the records to the delivery stream
Step 4
If any transformations and conversions are required choose the enable option and configure
accordingly.
Step 5 Choose the destination as Amazon S3 bucket in which you wanted to store the data
thatâ€™s streamed.
Step 6
Choose the buffer size and buffer interval to deliver the data records to S3 bucket and if
compression is required make the required configuration setting.
Step 7
If encryption of the streamlined data and error logging during data ingestion is required you can
enable them.
Step 8
Choose the cream IAM role that attaches the default policies of Kinesis Firehose and Click Next.
Step 9 - The delivery stream would be created.
Step 10 - Click on the delivery stream and test the data streamlining ingestion process by
sending a sample data.
PS: These steps will take some time to execute, you may need to wait for same.
Step 11 - The demo sample data would be sent to the stream. This process takes a while.
Step 12
Click on Stop sending data to stop the streaming. You can monitor the data being ingested to
the streamline using CloudWatch Dashboards.
Step 13
Navigate to the S3 bucket which is the destination and the streamlined data would be stored in
a form of an object which can be viewed.
Summary: Thus, in this lab, you have learnt how to streamline the data from Firehose and store
it in a S3 bucket in a form of an object.
